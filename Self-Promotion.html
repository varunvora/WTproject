	<h1 class="underline"> Self Promortion on CHEATiT </h1>

	<p class="alignment">Self-promotion is generally frowned upon, but if you want to have a presence on CHEATiT you should fully read the <a href="FAQs.html" target="_blank"><span>FAQs</span></a> so that you understand the culture and social norms. If you run a website, publication, blog, app, or other project and would like to participate on CHEATiT, you'll need to first make sure that you're following all of the guidelines in the FAQ on spam. </p>

	<h4 class="subHeadsubMain"> Here are some guidelines for best practices: </h4>
		<p class="alignment"> 
		<ul>
			<li> You should not just start submitting your links - it will be unwelcome and may be removed as spam, or your account will be banned as spam.</li>
			<li> You should submit from a variety of sources (a general rule of thumb is that 10% or less of your posting and conversation should link to your own content), talk to people in the comments (and not just on your own links), and generally be a good member of the community.</li>
			<li> You should not vote up only things from your domain or project, or have any other employees or fans do the same. Every CHEATiT or should evaluate and vote on each submission or comment based on the value when they read it. Only submitting on, or voting on, one particular person, domain, or brand's content will get an account banned from CHEATiT - it's called <a href="FAQs.html#voteCheat" target="_blank"><spam>vote cheating and manipulation</spam></a>.</li>
			<li> You should not ask for votes on CHEATiT, even on your twitter or blog or forum - it will get your account banned, and in extreme cases can get your domain banned.</li>
			<li> You should join subCHEATiTs that are relevant to your interests. Give feedback to others, talk about issues that interest you, and be a good member of the community. CHEATiTors don't care that you have something to promote, they care what you think and that you have interesting things to say.</li>
			<li >You should check your domain page from time to time - it is located at CHEATiT.com/domain/<yourdomainhere.com> - check out what people are saying, what stuff of yours people like, and participate in the comments if people have questions or comments about something you've done. Identify yourself and be transparent: "Hi, I'm the author of this article, and I can answer the question you have about that..." But don't blindly upvote everything there or try to manipulate voting in any way - if your stuff is good, people will vote for it.</li>
			<li> After you have found a subCHEATiT that relates to something you'd like to submit, you should read the sidebar to see if your link is appropriate there. If you're not sure, message the moderators and ask! Every subCHEATiT is run by different moderators and have different rules. If your link isn't okay in one CHEATiT, look for a different one on a similar topic that might find it welcome.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

	<h4 class="subHeadsubMain"> Things that should go without saying </h4>
		<p class="alignment"> You may never offer money or compensation to anyone to promote anything on CHEATiT for you. Things should be submitted on CHEATiT by CHEATiTors who have found your content organically and submitted it because they found it interesting. You should never run a contest to see "who can get a link highest on CHEATiT" or ask anyone to submit links on your behalf. </p>
		<p> You should not spam in any way, especially through private message. You should not hide your affiliation to your project or site, or lie about who you are or why you like something. You should never, ever buy votes or ask for votes - if you stuff is good enough, people will vote for it naturally. If all of your employees or contributors vote on all of your links, their accounts and possibly your domain will be banned.</p>
		<p> Don't use sockpuppets to promote your content on CHEATiT. It's tacky and cheap, and detracts from your brand. Additionally, it can get your domain or brand banned from CHEATiT, and these things have a tendency to go viral and create a backlash against you. Be authentic and honest and things will go much better for you.</p>

	<h4 class="subHeadsubMain"> But it's not spam! I worked hard on that, I make no money from it, it's original content! I'm not a spammer! </h4>
		<p class="alignment"> We're not making a judgement on your quality, just your behavior on CHEATiT. Your stuff's probably amazing and someone would be really interested in it but... <br />
		If you submit mostly your own links and your presence on CHEATiT is mostly for your self-promotion of your brand, page, blog, app, or business, you are more likely to be a spammer than you think! <a href="FAQs.html" target="_blank"><span>Read the FAQ</span></a> and make sure that you really understand that. </p>
